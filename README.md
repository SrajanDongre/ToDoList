🧠 How It Works

The user can add a task by typing it in and pressing Enter.

Tasks are displayed in a clean list format.

Users can edit, delete, or mark tasks as done.

After the completion of all the tasks , a notification to congratulate you pops out.

The app stores data in localStorage or a database, so tasks persist even after refresh.
